        <h1>Premier League News</h1>

        <p> The Premier League season has only just ended yet we are already seeing moves in the transfer market as clubs look to steal a march on their rivals before the new campaign.<br>

With a winter World Cup on the horizon, the English top flight kicks off again on 6 August - under 10 weeks away - and there are signs it is going to be a busy summer of business.<br>

Erling Haaland's switch to <em class="club-names">Manchester City</em> has taken most of the early headlines while Ivan Perisic's move to <em class="club-names">Tottenham</em> will have their fans excited.<br>

Other early transfer activity includes <em class="club-names"> Leeds United's </em> £25m move for <em class="club-names"> Red Bull Salzburg's </em> Brenden Aaronson, <em class="club-names"> Liverpool's </em> capture of <em class="club-names"> Fulham's </em> Fabio Carvalho, and <em class="club-names"> Aston Villa's </em> double move for Diego Carlos and Boubacar Kamara.<br>

But with the gossip column vibrant and speculation rife about numerous players coming to England from the continent, BBC Sport takes a look at some of the other new faces we could be seeing next season.</p>
    <h2>Julian Alvarez</h2>

    A signing that has been completed, with the Argentina forward joining <em class="club-names"> Manchester City </em> from <em class="club-names"> River Plate</em> in January. He has yet to be seen by English football fans though, after being loaned straight back to the <em>Argentine</em> champions.<br>

Dubbed the 'new Aguero' by some, Alvarez's expected arrival in the City squad this summer will be overshadowed by the presence of Haaland but there are plenty tipping the 22-year-old to make his own big impact in Manchester.<br>

The £14.4m signing, who is predominantly a striker but can play out wide, recently scored six goals in a Copa Libertadores match and has six full caps to his name.<br>

    A regular name in the gossip column and a striker undoubtedly attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs.<br>

The <em class="club-names">Benfica </em> forward scored 34 goals in 43 games for his club last season, including six in the Champions League, and it is widely reported that he will move on this summer despite having three years left on his contract.<br>

<em class="club-names" id="manutd">Manchester United </em>, <em class="club-names">Liverpool</em>, <em class="club-names">Arsenal</em> and <em class="club-names">Newcastle United</em> have all been linked with moves for the 22-year-old but he is not going to come cheap, with <em class="club-names">Benfica</em> reported to want in the region of £100m.<br>
